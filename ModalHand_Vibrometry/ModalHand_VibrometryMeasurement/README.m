% Script used to capture high and low spatial resolution vibrometry data on
% the human hand.
% Two cases were considered. One in which the back of the hand was fixed to
% a rigid support structure. One in which the back of the hand was free to
% oscillate.
% Vibrations were supplied to the finger using an B&K actuator.
% Fingertip preload of 3 Newton.
